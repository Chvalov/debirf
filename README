Debirf includes a set of example debirf profiles in
/usr/share/doc/debirf/example-profiles/.  Right now these include:

minimal: very minimal system with no extras
rescue: includes some extra disk rescue utilities 
xkiosk: sets up a diskless kiosk with a web browser

Each of these profiles includes a debirf.conf, and a modules directory
that includes links to the various modules that the profile uses.
Start by unpacking one of the example profiles:

$ tar xzf /usr/share/debirf/example-profiles/minimal.tgz

You can then modify the debirf.conf as desired.
