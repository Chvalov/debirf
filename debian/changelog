debirf (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * new create_initrd_nested build function, boots debirf into tmpfs, which is cleaner and more stable and is now the default.
  * added ability to run make-debirf with fakechroot ('-f' option).  there are problems creating the device tree with this method, though, so it is still underdevelopment.
  * modified debootstrap, plugin run-parts, and debirf_exec to also use fakechroot
  * being root *should* no longer be necessary to make-debirf, therefore make-debirf has been moved to /usr/bin/
  * debirf can now function in rootfs with stock debian kernels (as of 2.6.22)
  * removed /var/lib/debirf
  * removed /etc/debirf in favor of doc/example-profiles
  * added xkiosk plugin to start X session with browser on startup
  * added xkiosk profile
  * added getopt for command line argument checking
  * added command line arguments to skip some checking/user interaction
  * can now pass kernel package name to make-debirf, instead of just deb, although proper package checking is not fully working
