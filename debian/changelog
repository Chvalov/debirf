debirf (0.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * example profiles are now tgz archives (closes #46)
  * added new full devices.tar.gz to create fuller device tree, therefore
    not requiring the install-udev module (closes #60)
  * transition to non-native packaging (closes #26)
  * added exit-on-error to modules install run-parts
  * removed old useless create_initrd functions

debirf (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * change name of "plugins" to "modules".  hopefully this will elliminate
    at least my uneasyness about the requirement of some of the modules.
    this will require people to rename their existing "plugins"
    directories to be "modules".
  * re-added prep-root module
  * expanded info in debirf.conf on image, includes debirf version (ticket #21)

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Fri, 21 Dec 2007 17:21:22 -0500

debirf (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * finally, working fakechroot/non-privileged build method!  superuser
    privileges no longer required (and are in fact now discouraged)
  * udev is now required for non-pirvileged builds to function, though.
  * make tmpfs 10G by default
  * prune some unneeded packages (cron, logrotate, ed, tcpd, tasksel)

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Thu, 20 Dec 2007 09:17:02 -0500

debirf (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * moved all files to GPLv3 (closes #50)
  * simplify kernel installation.  now will accept deb as command line
    parameter, or make-debirf will just figure out the kernel itself
    (closes #48)
  * updated man page

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Tue, 11 Dec 2007 15:31:22 -0500

debirf (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * added DEBIRF_KERNEL_PACKAGE to debirf.conf
  * added more informative error message when profile is malformed.

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Mon, 10 Dec 2007 17:52:43 -0500

debirf (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * simplified profile checking.
  * fixed/cleaned-up install-kernel plugin to extract kernel rather than
    install (ticket #49).
  * added install-udev plugin.

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Mon, 10 Dec 2007 12:12:04 -0500

debirf (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * added ability to just create initramfs from pre-build root.

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Mon, 03 Dec 2007 23:13:34 -0500

debirf (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * new create_initrd_nested build function, boots debirf into tmpfs,
    which is cleaner and more stable and is now the default.
  * added ability to run make-debirf with fakechroot ('-f' option).  there
    are problems creating the device tree with this method, though, so it
    is still underdevelopment.
  * modified debootstrap, plugin run-parts, and debirf_exec to also use
    fakechroot
  * being root *should* no longer be necessary to make-debirf, therefore
    make-debirf has been moved to /usr/bin/
  * debirf can now function in rootfs with stock debian kernels (as of 2.6.22)
  * removed /var/lib/debirf
  * removed /etc/debirf in favor of doc/example-profiles
  * added xkiosk plugin to start X session with browser on startup
  * added xkiosk profile
  * added getopt for command line argument checking
  * added command line arguments to skip some checking/user interaction
  * can now pass kernel package name to make-debirf, instead of just deb,
    although proper package checking is not fully working

 -- Jameson Rollins <jrollins@fifthhorseman.net>  Mon, 03 Dec 2007 00:40:46 -0500

debirf (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed old broken references to DEBIAN_PATH environment variable

  * mknod /dev/ttyS0 in serial-terminal plugin
  * moved profiles directory to /etc/debirf/profiles
  * added 'minimal' profile
