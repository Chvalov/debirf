debirf (0.36) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Debirf can now better handle all package includes/excludes entirely
    during the debootstrap stage.  Package includes/excludes can either be
    specified in a profile "packages" file (as a one-per-line '+'/'-'
    list), or using a "#DEBIRF_PACKAGE>" comment in module scripts.  See
    debirf(1) for more info.

debirf (0.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to incompatibilities between squeeze and lenny, it is currently
    not possible to build a lenny debirf image on a squeeze or newer
    system.  Squeeze is now the default distro for debirf images.  For
    more info, see: http://cmrg.fifthhorseman.net/ticket/105
