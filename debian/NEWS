debirf (0.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to incompatibilities between squeeze and lenny, it is currently
    not possible to build a lenny debirf image on a squeeze or newer
    system.  Squeeze is now the default distro for debirf images.  For
    more info, see: http://cmrg.fifthhorseman.net/ticket/105
