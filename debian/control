Description: build a kernel and initrd to run Debian from RAM
 debirf (DEBian on Initial Ram Filesystem) is a set of tools designed
 to create and prepare a kernel and initial ram filesystem that can
 run a full-blown Debian environment entirely from RAM.
 .
 The kernel and initrd pair created by debirf can be used for a myriad of
 purposes, from quick-and-easy system repair to diskless thin clients.  The
 kernel and initrd can be placed in your system boot partition, burnt to
 read-only media, or supplied by a netboot server.
 .
 The debirf tools use a plugin architecture which allows you to customize
 debirf for any possible purpose by specifying what components are included
 in the generated image.
