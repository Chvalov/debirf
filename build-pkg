# run this script from the top level of your working directory to
# build a debirf debian package in ./tmp

# you must have the svn and devscripts packages installed.

# find the repository path:
REPO=$(svn info | grep ^URL:\ | awk '{ print $2 }')

# extract the version number from the changelog:
VERS=$(head -n1 debian/changelog | awk '{ print $2 }' | sed 's|[^[:digit:].]||g')

# export the baseline from the repo into a clean directory:
rm -rf ./tmp
mkdir ./tmp
svn export "$REPO" ./tmp/debirf-"$VERS" 

# apply any unapplied changes from the wd to the building copy:
svn diff | (cd ./tmp/debirf-"$VERS" && patch)

# actually build:
(cd ./tmp/debirf-"$VERS" && debuild -uc -us)
