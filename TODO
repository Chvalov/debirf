TODO:

create an initial plugin directory that links to all/many of the default plugins
   and gives the user a chance to add/remove what they want.

should specify which plugins are considered essential, as opposed to just useful. 

other potential plugins:
- change root/etc/motd.tail
- a "disk-rescue" plugin that adds all potentially useful disk tools

possibly trim more packages
