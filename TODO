TODO:

create an initial plugin directory that links to all/many of the default plugins
   and gives the user a chance to add/remove what they want.

plugins:
- motd: change root/etc/motd.tail
- disk-rescue: a plugin that adds all potentially useful disk tools
- remove-locales: parameterize which locale you want to leave in place

possibly trim more files/packages

make-debirf should know its version number and record it somewhere in
   each image it creates

backup all files removed so that the pruning step is reversible

man page for debirf.conf(5)
